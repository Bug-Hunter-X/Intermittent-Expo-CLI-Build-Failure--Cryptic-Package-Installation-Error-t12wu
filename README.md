# Intermittent Expo CLI Build Failure: Cryptic Package Installation Error

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered while building an Expo application using the Expo CLI. The error is intermittent, making it difficult to diagnose. The error messages are vague and standard troubleshooting techniques like reinstalling node_modules or checking network connectivity did not resolve the issue.

The primary issue is an unexpected failure during package installation, leading to a build failure. The root cause is not immediately apparent from the error messages. The bug.js file contains a simplified representation of the project structure and the problematic package. The bugSolution.js demonstrates a potential solution or workaround. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Try running `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`. 
4. Observe the intermittent build failures.

## Potential Solutions

The bugSolution.js file offers a workaround. It is suspected to be related to npm caching. The proposed solution involves clearing npm's cache and reinstalling packages. The details are outlined in the solution file itself.

## Additional Notes

This issue might be related to network connectivity, npm configuration, or a less-common issue with package resolution within Expo's build process. Further investigation might be required to determine the precise root cause.
