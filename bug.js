While building an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error during the installation of a package. The error message was quite cryptic and didn't provide much context.  I had already ensured all the dependencies were correctly specified in my package.json file. I tried reinstalling the node_modules folder multiple times, but the issue persisted. I also checked my network connection and ensured that npm was up to date. The error message itself included some stack trace, but it was not immediately clear what was the root cause.  The error was intermittent too; sometimes it would build successfully and other times not.
